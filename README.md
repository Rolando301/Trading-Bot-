📈 Automated Trading Bot – Supply & Demand Strategy

This project is an automated trading bot designed to trade financial markets independently based on a predefined set of rules. The bot combines strict risk management, supply and demand analysis, and support and resistance logic to identify high-probability trading opportunities while minimizing downside risk.

The system continuously monitors market conditions and executes trades without manual intervention. Every decision—entry, stop loss, take profit, and position sizing—is governed by clearly defined rules to ensure consistency, discipline, and repeatability in trading behavior.

🔑 Core Features

Fully Automated Trading
The bot operates autonomously, scanning the market, placing orders, and managing open positions based on the strategy logic.

Risk Management First
All trades follow predefined risk parameters, such as a fixed percentage risk per trade, dynamic position sizing, and mandatory stop-loss placement to protect capital.

Supply & Demand / Support & Resistance Strategy
The bot identifies key price zones where strong buying or selling pressure is likely to occur and only executes trades when price reacts within these zones under valid conditions.

Rule-Based Decision Making
The strategy eliminates emotional trading by enforcing strict rules that define:

Trade entry conditions

Stop-loss and take-profit placement

Situations where no trade should be taken

Performance Analysis & Customization
Additionally, users are expected to analyze the bot’s performance over time to ensure it behaves as intended. This includes reviewing trade history, win/loss ratios, drawdowns, and overall profitability. Based on this analysis, the code can be modified or optimized to better match the user’s risk tolerance, market conditions, or trading goals.

Market-Agnostic Design
The bot can be configured to trade multiple instruments such as Forex, Gold, Crypto, or Indices, depending on broker and symbol settings.

⚙️ How It Works (High-Level)

The bot analyzes price action to detect valid supply and demand or support and resistance zones.

It waits for price to return to these zones and checks whether all trading conditions are satisfied.

If criteria align, the bot calculates position size based on risk rules and executes the trade.

Trades are actively managed until stop loss or take profit is reached.
